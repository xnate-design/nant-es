# Promise constructor

The Promise constructor:

<Blockquote>

1. is %Promise%.
2. is the initial value of the "Promise" property of the global object.
3. creates and initializes a new Promise when called as a constructor.
4. is not intended to be called as a function and will throw an exception when called in that manner.
5. may be used as the value in an extends clause of a class definition.
   Subclass constructors that intend to inherit the specified Promise behaviour must include a super
   call to the Promise constructor to create and initialize the subclass instance with the internal
   state necessary to support the Promise and Promise.prototype built-in methods.
</Blockquote>


## Promise

This function performs the following steps when called:

<Blockquote>
1. If NewTarget is undefined, throw a TypeError exception.
2. If IsCallable(executor) is false, throw a TypeError exception.
3. Let promise be ? OrdinaryCreateFromConstructor(NewTarget, "%Promise.prototype%", « [[PromiseState]], [[PromiseResult]], [[PromiseFulfillReactions]], [[PromiseRejectReactions]], [[PromiseIsHandled]] »).
4. Set promise.[[PromiseState]] to PENDING.
5. Set promise.[[PromiseFulfillReactions]] to a new empty List.
6. Set promise.[[PromiseRejectReactions]] to a new empty List.
7. Set promise.[[PromiseIsHandled]] to false.
8. Let resolvingFunctions be CreateResolvingFunctions(promise).
9. Let completion be Completion(Call(executor, undefined, « resolvingFunctions.[[Resolve]], resolvingFunctions.[[Reject]] »)).
10. If completion is an abrupt completion, then
a. Perform ? Call(resolvingFunctions.[[Reject]], undefined, « completion.[[Value]] »).
11. Return promise.

<Note>
  <strong>Note 1:</strong><br/>
  The executor argument must be a function object. It is called for initiating and reporting completion of
  the possibly deferred action represented by this Promise. The executor is called with two arguments:
  resolve and reject. These are functions that may be used by the executor function to report eventual
  completion or failure of the deferred computation. Returning from the executor function does not mean
  that the deferred action has been completed but only that the request to eventually perform the deferred
  action has been accepted.
</Note>

<Note>
  <strong>Note 2:</strong><br/>
  The resolve function that is passed to an executor function accepts a single argument. The executor code may
  eventually call the resolve function to indicate that it wishes to resolve the associated Promise. The argument
  passed to the resolve function represents the eventual value of the deferred action and can be either the actual
  fulfillment value or another promise which will provide the value if it is fulfilled.
</Note>

<Note>
  <strong>Note 3:</strong><br/>
  The reject function that is passed to an executor function accepts a single argument. The executor code may
  eventually call the reject function to indicate that the associated Promise is rejected and will never be
  fulfilled. The argument passed to the reject function is used as the rejection value of the promise.
  Typically it will be an Error object.
</Note>

<Note>
  <strong>Note 4:</strong><br/>
  The resolve and reject functions passed to an executor function by the Promise constructor have the capability
  to actually resolve and reject the associated promise. Subclasses may have different constructor behaviour that
  passes in customized values for resolve and reject.
